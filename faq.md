- [Q1: What are differences from other tensor network libraries supporting machine learning?](#q1)?

### <a id="q1">Q1</a>

A critical difference is that our library is based on Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI). TCI allows us to compute tensor networks with a low-rank representation by exploring a tiny subset of the full tensor. This opens up the possibility of applying tensor networks to unconventional applications such as high-dimensional integration, i.e., replacing Monte Carlo integration.
