This website collects information from the Tensor4All group which is working on tensor network methods.


## Literature

A pedagogical introduction to tensor network methods, which includes an overview of the existing literature and also new algorithms, can be found in:

> Yuriel Núñez Fernández, Marc K. Ritter, Matthieu Jeannin, Jheng-Wei Li, Thomas Kloss, Olivier Parcollet, Jan von Delft, Hiroshi Shinaoka, and Xavier Waintal, 
> *Learning low-rank tensor train representations: new algorithms and libraries*, *in preparation*, (2024).

## Code

We provide two software libraries that implement algorithms from the above manuscript for computing low-rank tensor representations.
One code is called Xfac (written in C++ with Python bindings), and a second implementation with similar functionality is based on Julia:

* [Xfac (C++ / Python)](https://xfac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
* [Julia code](julia.html)

## Workshops

We organize [workshops](workshop/index.html) to discuss the development of new methods.

## People

Check the [about](about.html) page to see who is involved in the Tensor4All collaboration.
