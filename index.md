This website collects information from the tensor4all group which is working on tensor network methods based on tensor cross interpolation (TCI) and related tensor learning algorithms such as quantics/quantized tensor trains.

## News

The House of Quantum Alps, the University of Saitama and the University of Munich LMU co-organize an
International workshop on tensor cross interpolation and other algorithms for learning tensor networks.

* 📅 From October 6th to October 10th, 2025
* 📍 Y Spot Partners, Grenoble, France
* 📝 Registration is free but subject to approval (We only have only 50 available slots in total).
* 👤 Call for oral presentations and poster is open.

If you want to register, you need to create an account on scienceconf.org and register by following the steps on https://tensornetworks.sciencesconf.org.

## Literature

A pedagogical introduction to tensor network methods, which includes an overview of the existing literature and also new algorithms, can be found in:

> Yuriel Núñez Fernández, Marc K. Ritter, Matthieu Jeannin, Jheng-Wei Li, Thomas Kloss, Thibaud Louvet, Satoshi Terasaki, Olivier Parcollet, Jan von Delft, Hiroshi Shinaoka, and Xavier Waintal, "Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries", [arXiv:2407.02454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454).

Please check the [reference](reference.html) page for more information on TCI and quantics tensor trains.

## Code

We provide two software libraries that implement algorithms from the above manuscript for computing low-rank tensor representations.
The code focuses on recent applications of tensor networks to objects that do not necessarily involve many-body quantum mechanics. 
It also contain known and new variants of the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm for unfolding tensors into tensor trains.
One code is called Xfac (written in C++ with Python bindings), and a second implementation with similar functionality is based on Julia:

* [Julia](julia.html)
