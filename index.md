This website collects information from the tensor4all group which is working on tensor network methods.


## Literature

A pedagogical introduction to tensor network methods, which includes an overview of the existing literature and also new algorithms, can be found in:

> *Learning low-rank tensor train representations: new algorithms and libraries*, *in preparation*, (2024).

Please check the [reference](reference.html) page for more information on TCI and quantics tensor trains.

## Code

We provide two software libraries that implement algorithms from the above manuscript for computing low-rank tensor representations.
The code focuses on recent applications of tensor networks to objects that do not necessarily involve many-body quantum mechanics. 
It also contain known and new variants of the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm for unfolding tensors into tensor trains.
One code is called Xfac (written in C++ with Python bindings), and a second implementation with similar functionality is based on Julia:

* [Xfac (C++ / Python)](https://xfac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
* [Julia](julia.html)

## Monthly online meeting
We have a monthly online meeting to discuss the development of new methods and applications. Zoom links will be provided through a mailing list. Please contact [us](<mailto:h.shinaoka@gmail.com>) if you would like to join the mailing list.

## Workshops

We organize [workshops](workshop/index.html) to discuss the development of new methods.

## People

Check the [about](about.html) page to see who is involved in the tensor4all collaboration.
