This website collects information from the tensor4all group which is working on tensor network methods based on tensor cross interpolation (TCI) and related tensor learning algorithms such as quantics/quantized tensor trains.

## Literature

A pedagogical introduction to tensor network methods, which includes an overview of the existing literature and also new algorithms, can be found in:

> Yuriel NÃºÃ±ez FernÃ¡ndez, Marc K. Ritter, Matthieu Jeannin, Jheng-Wei Li, Thomas Kloss, Thibaud Louvet, Satoshi Terasaki, Olivier Parcollet, Jan von Delft, Hiroshi Shinaoka, and Xavier Waintal, "Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries", [arXiv:2407.02454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454).

Please check the [reference](reference.html) page for more information on TCI and quantics tensor trains.

## Code

We provide two software libraries that implement algorithms from the above manuscript for computing low-rank tensor representations.
The code focuses on recent applications of tensor networks to objects that do not necessarily involve many-body quantum mechanics. 
It also contain known and new variants of the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm for unfolding tensors into tensor trains.
One code is called Xfac (written in C++ with Python bindings), and a second implementation with similar functionality is based on Julia:

* [Julia](julia.html)

## Monthly online meeting
We have a monthly online meeting to discuss the development of new methods and applications. Zoom links will be provided through a mailing list (49 registered users as of November 4th, 2024). Please contact [us](<mailto:tensor4all-admin@googlegroups.com>) if you would like to join the mailing list.
